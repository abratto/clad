# CLAD — Contract-Led, Artefact-Driven Development

> A starter repository for building software with AI coding agents under a
> discipline that keeps every decision **legible, reviewable, and reversible**.

CLAD combines three ideas that, taken together, let a single human reviewer
steer multi-step agent work without losing control of the system being built:

1. **CLAD (process)** — every change flows through *contracts* (small,
   reviewable specs) and produces *artefacts* (files on disk you can diff).
   No work happens off-contract; no artefact is born without a contract.
2. **Legible architecture (WYSIWID pattern)** — runtime is decomposed into
   independent **concepts** (small state machines with explicit operational
   principles) connected only by declarative **synchronizations**. What you
   read in a concept spec is what the running system does. Adapted from
   Meng & Jackson, *What You See Is What It Does* (Onward! 2025).
3. **ICM workspace scaffold** — each feature lives in its own folder of
   numbered stages (`01_usecase/`, `02_concepts/`, …). Each stage has a
   `CONTEXT.md` *contract* (Inputs / Process / Outputs) and an `output/`
   folder the human can inspect and edit before the next stage runs.
   Adapted from Van Clief, *Interpretable Context Methodology*.

```
actors/goals -> use case -> responsibility map -> chain tables ->
concepts -> syncs -> dependency review -> implement -> verify
   (00)        (01)        (02a)              (02b)
   (02)        (03)        (03a)              (04)        (05)
```

At every arrow there is a folder you can open, a `CONTEXT.md` contract
that tells the agent what to do, and an `output/` folder you can inspect
and edit before the next stage runs. The full stage table lives in
[`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) §3.

## Status

**Seed.** This repo bootstraps the methodology, templates, agent guides, a
worked example ([`features/UC-00-login/`](features/UC-00-login/README.md))
taken end-to-end through Stage 04 (the LoginFlowTest is currently
`@Disabled` pending Stage 05 closure), and an optional Java reference
profile under [`reference-impl/java-micronaut-jena/`](reference-impl/java-micronaut-jena/).
The broader reference implementation lives at
[abratto/tastetag](https://github.com/abratto/tastetag) and will be ported
into `reference-impl/` over subsequent PRs.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abratto/clad.git
cd clad
# Read in this order:
#   1. README.md (you are here)
#   2. AGENTS.md                       ← canonical guide for any AI coding agent
#   3. methodology/README.md           ← reading order for the methodology
#   4. methodology/WALKTHROUGH.md      ← annotated UC-00 session, turn by turn
#   5. features/UC-00-login/README.md  ← the worked example itself
```

### Your first prompt to the agent

After cloning, open a chat with your agent (Copilot, Claude, Cursor,
Codex, …) in this workspace and send exactly this:

> Read `AGENTS.md` in full, then `CONTEXT.md`, then
> `methodology/README.md`, then `methodology/WALKTHROUGH.md`. Confirm you
> understand the five-layer hierarchy and the stage flow, then wait for
> my feature brief.

That loads the binding rules (`AGENTS.md`), the workspace router
(`CONTEXT.md`), the methodology reading order, and an annotated example
of what a single CLAD turn looks like — without pulling in any
feature-specific material the agent shouldn't have yet.

### Your second prompt — start a feature

> Copy `templates/feature-skeleton/` to `features/UC-01-<slug>/`. Then
> open `features/UC-01-<slug>/stages/00_actor-goal/CONTEXT.md` and run
> Stage 00 against this brief: *<one paragraph describing what you want
> the system to let users do>*.

The agent will then run **Stage 00 (actor/goal)**: it proposes a draft
actor list and goal list, asks up to five clarifying questions, and
**waits for your answers** before writing `actors.md` / `goals.md`. From
there each subsequent stage produces one artefact, asks *"Do you agree
with this step? Any corrections before I continue?"*, and stops at the
gate.

> Note: copy `templates/feature-skeleton/`, not `features/UC-00-login/`.
> The skeleton carries empty stage folders with their `CONTEXT.md`
> contracts already in place; the worked example is for reading.
